# ðŸ§  Healthcare Disease Prediction â€” Advanced Machine Learning Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project aims to predict diseases based on patient health records using advanced machine learning techniques. It follows a complete end-to-end data science workflow â€” from data preprocessing to model training, tuning, evaluation, explainability, and deployment readiness.

The objective is to build a robust and interpretable prediction system that can help identify possible diseases early, enabling better medical support. It supports exporting predictions and explanations, making it ready for integration into real-world tools or healthcare dashboards.
